## Summary

FrostyBot is a minimal endpoint that is designed to be used with webhooks in Tradingview alerts. It receives simple commands and translates them to specific exchange orders and sends them to the exchange. This allows you to write your strategies and do your backtesting on Tradingview, and then easily integrate your strategies with your exchange once you are happy with the backtest. This then allows you to use Tradingview as your trading engine, with Frostybot merely facilitating the integration to your exchange.

The way it works is simple:

* Going short if you are already long will place a short order for the size of your existing long position plus the amount of contracts you requested short, leaving you short the size requested. For example, if you are already long 10000 contracts and you enter a short order for 5000 contracts, the bot will actually place a sell order for 15000 contracts, leaving you 5000 contracts short after the order is filled (vice versa for short to long flips). This is done to simplify the bot logic to be written in Pinescript.
* If you are long 10000 contracts, and you enter a 150000 long order, the bot will place a buy order for only 5000 contracts, leaving you 15000 contracts long when the order is filled. If you are already long more contracts than requested, no additional order will be placed (vice versa for short orders). This allows you to control the maximum size you would like to be long or short, irrelevent of how many times Pinescript triggers the order.
* Anything that can trigger an alert in Tradingview can be used with this bot for trade execution, such as the crossing of a trendline, EMA crosses, etc. If you create your own Pinescript studies, use the alertcondition function to define alerts for buy, sell, stop loss and take profit orders as you need, and then create alerts on those alert conditions to trigger the bot. The possibilities are endless!

## Dedication

Dedicated to @christiaan's mom, not only is she hot, but she's a classy lady too.

## Disclaimer
Use this bot at your own risk. The authors accept no responsibility for losses incurred through using this software. This is a 0.x release which means it's beta software. So it may and probably will have some bugs. We strongly advise you to use a sub-account with a limited balance, or a testnet account to ensure that the bot is profitable before going live with any strategy. While we have gone to great lengths to test the software, if you do find any bugs, please report them to us and we will sort them out, but if you lose your account, that's on you.
            
## Supported Exchanges
Currently Bitmex, Deribit and FTX exchanges are supported for perpetual and futures markets. For a list of markets supported on your exchange, use the <exchange>:markets command. The bot has been extensively tested on these markets, but should work on others as well:
 
* **Bitmex:**  BTC/USD and ETH/USD
* **Deribit:** BTC-PERPETUAL and ETH-PERPETUAL
* **FTX:** BTC-PERP and ETH-PERP

We will add more exchanges based on user demand. Keeping the code cross-compatible over all the exchanges is quite complex so we will only consider adding additional exchanges if a significant number of users request it. Bear in mind that this software is free, so we are under no obgligation to add features or provide support, but we will endevour to help out when and where we can. Support can also be found in #the-lab channel on Krown's Crypto Cave Discord community. There are a lot of very knowlegeable guys willing to help out if you need assistance.

## Scope      
This bot is speficially designed to execute orders based on webhook alerts received from Tradingview. If you have used Autoview in the past you will understand the concept of converting Tradingview strategies and scripts into executable orders on your exchange. However, unlike Autoview, Frostybot makes use of an external web server (VPS, AWS etc), so does not require your PC to be powered on or your browser to be open for it to work. 

## Requirements
In order to use Frostybot, you will need the following:
* A Linux server which is publicly accessible over the Internet (either by public IP address, DDNS or DNAT). You must be able to access the web server publicly for Frostybot to work. We recommend using the free Ubuntu server available on [Amazon Lightsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com). They also offer a free public IP address. There is also [a handy guide here](https://www.airix.net/en/projects/the-virtual-private-server-in-the-cloud) which will show you how to set up your Lightsail VPS and all the prerequisite software.
* Apache2/Nginx (whichever you prefer). We highly recommend that you secure it with HTTPS (using [LetsEncrypt](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04) or something similar). It's free, so there's really no excuse for having an insecure web server.
* PHP 7.2 or higher. You will need the following PHP modules installed (php-curl, php-mbstring, php-json, php-sqlite3, php-cli), and you will need to ensure that PHP is configured on your web server.
* If you want to clone Frostybot from Github, you will need to have git installed.

We must stress that the setup and configuration of Linux/Apache/Nginx/PHP is **not** within the scope of this guide. If you need help configuring those things, there is a vast knowlegebase of information and guides available on the Internet.

## Installation

Check out our installation and configuration guide at [FrostyBot Install Guide](https://github.com/CryptoMF/frostybot/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md).

## Upgrading from a Previous Version of Frostybot
Version 0.9 has been completely redeveloped from the ground up. The command syntax is different and there is no way to import your old configuration into the new version. We recommend that you install this new version from scratch and remove any prior versions of Frostybot that you have installed.

## Changelog

The current version of FrostyBot is 0.9. This version constitutes a massive overhaul of the entire codebase and is basically a redevelopment from scratch, with loads of new features and capabilities.

A big shoutout to everybody who has contributed and collaborated on this project. The changelog is available at [FrostyBot Changelog](https://github.com/CryptoMF/frostybot/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Usage
Its recommended to use sub-accounts to limit risk. First follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](https://github.com/CryptoMF/frostybot/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md). Then configure your Tradingview alerts to call the webhook using the appropriate commands:

* Add your Exchange API account information to the cfg/cfg.config.php file. You can have multiple configurations in the file, even for the same exchange (for mainnet/testnet configs), as long as they have distinct account stubs in the accounts array. Use the example layout below to see how to do it. Typically you would only configure one or two accounts, depending on your needs. You do not have to configure all of these accounts, and you can add or remove accounts from the array as required. Just keep and eye on the PHP syntax so you don't break anything.

Example account settings in the cfg/cfg.config.php file:

```php
    // Account settings
    const accounts = [                      
        'ftxmain' =>  [                                 // This is the account stub, which is used in <stub>:<command>, for example ftxmain:POSITIONS. NOTE: If you are using a subaccount on FTX, see the ftxsub config below instead.
            'description'   => 'FTX Main Account',      // This is a general description of the account, for your own information
            'exchange'      => 'ftx',                   // The exchange that this account is on (ftx/deribit/bitmex)
            'parameters'    =>  [

                'secret'    =>  'ABC123abc123',         // Replace this with your actual FTX sub account API secret (if you want to use it)
            ],

                'BTCUSD'    =>  'BTC-PERP',             // Map BTCUSD to BTC-PERP on the exchange
                'ETHUSD'    =>  'ETH-PERP',             // Map ETHUSD to ETH-PERP on the exchange

                'headers'   => [
                    'FTX-SUBACCOUNT' => 'MySubAccount'  // Update this with the name of your sub account (if using a sub account). This is REQUIRED if using a sub account on FTX.

```

Using the config above, some example command syntax would be as follows: 
    
    bitmexmain:long size=5000 price=8000 symbol=BTC/USD  (This example provides the symbol in the command)
    ftxsub:short size=5000 price=8000 symbol=BTCUSD      (This example uses a symbol mapping in the config file to convert BTCUSD to BTC-PERP)
    deribittest:short size=5000 price=8000               (This example uses the "default" symbol mapping in the config file which is mapped to BTC-PERPETUAL)    
    
*Note:* The order size is always in USD, and the symbol is required for most exchange-specific commands (unless a default symbol mapping has been provided in the config file, in which case that default symbol will be used if no symbol is provided in the command).

To get a list of supported symbols for an exchange, use the following command (notice the "deribittest" part of the command, and how it relates to the account settings in cfg/cfg.config.php as shown in the example above):

    ./frostybot deribittest:markets

* Once all your accounts are configured, ensure that the db/, cache/ and log/ directories are writable by the account that you use you run your web server (for example, www-data on Ubuntu). If for some reason you cannot make those directories writable, you can change the location of the directories in the cfg/cfg.config.php file. If you do change those settings, remember to relocate the directories to the new location. Check out the [FrostyBot Install Guide](https://github.com/CryptoMF/frostybot/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md) for more information on how to do this correctly.
* Run some FrostyBot CLI commands to check if you have done the configuration correctly and to ensure that you are able to reach the exchange (Some CLI commands examples are listed further below).
* Check that your bot is accessible over the public internet by browsing to it's address. You should see a message similar to the following:

    {
        "results": {
            "code": 900,
            "message": "Request received from invalid address: 123.69.123.69",
            "type": "ERROR"
        },
        "messages": []
    }

*Note:* This error is expected, but its a good way to check if your bot is responding over http/https. You will receive this specific error because the bot has built-in security that will only accept http/https requests from Tradingview's servers. You can still communicate directly with Frostybot using CLI commands. If you need to communicate to the bot over http, you will need to add your IP address into the "whitelist" setting in cfg/cfg.config.php. By default, only Tradingview's servers have access over http/https.

Once you've confirmed that Frostybot is responding over the internet, you can start creating Tradingview alerts:

* In Tradingview, create a new alert.
* The Webhook URL should point to your bot address.
* The message box of the Tradingview alert should have the bot command(s), here are some exmaples:
         
**Tradingview Alert Messagebox Examples:**

    deribit:long symbol=BTC-PERPETUAL size=1000         ($1000 market buy on Deribit BTC-PERPETUAL)
    ftx:short symbol=BTC-PERP size=2000 price=7600      ($2000 limit sell at $7600 on FTX BTC-PERP)
    bitmex:long symbol=BTC/USD size=3x                  (3x long market buy on Bitmex BTC/USD)
    ftx:close size=50% symbol=ETH-PERP                  (Market close 50% of oposition on FTX ETH-PERP)
    deribit:close symbol=ETH-PERPETUAL                  (Close entire ETH-PERPETUAL position on Deribit)
    ftx:short size=200% symbol=BTC-PERP                 (Market sell 200% of your account / 2x short)
      
*NOTE:* Anything in the message box of the Tradingview alert is interpreted as a command, so do not use the message box for a general description! Also note, you can provide multiple commands in the message box, as long as they are each on a new line. For example, you can close all your open stop loss orders before entering a new position.

Here is an example of a Tradingview alert showing multiple commands:

![TV Alert](https://i.imgur.com/p8YFTah.png)
     
Other than Tradingview firing off webhooks, you can also communicate manually with Frostybot using the commandline interface (CLI). Here are some CLI examples that you can try out.
 
**CLI Examples:** 

    ./frostybot deribit:long symbol=BTC-PERPETUAL size=1000     ($1000 market buy on Deribit BTC-PERPETUAL)
    ./frostybot ftx:short symbol=BTC-PERP size=2000 price=7600  ($2000 limit sell at $7600 on FTX BTC-PERP)
    ./frostybot bitmex:long symbol=BTC/USD size=3x              (3x market buy on Bitmex BTC/USD)
    ./frostybot ftx:close size=50% symbol=ETH-PERP              (Market close 50% of position on FTX ETH-PERP)
    ./frostybot deribit:close symbol=ETH-PERPETUAL              (Close entire ETH-PERPETUAL position on Deribit)

*NOTE:* The command syntax for Tradingview is exactly the same as for the CLI (except for the addition of ./frostybot in front of the command on the CLI). Any command that you can run on the CLI you can also run using webhooks. While this may not necessarily be useful for Tradingview, it can come in handy if you want to integrate something else with Frostybot. All Frostybot output is in JSON, which makes external integration, like scripting and charting quite simple.
