## Changelog

A huge thank you to all of those that have contributed and collaborated on FrostyBot over the past 6 months. A particular shoutout to @Barnz for his huge contribution to the bot. Many things have changed since I started out on this project, and this is still very much a work in progress. I hope to improve on it sugnificantly over the next year.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.6</td>
    <td>
<ul>
<li>ccxt installation via an install.sh script (and cleanup of 750 mb of unneeded files)\n- now bot is usable with testnet or alternate api endpoint urls (base api url is now configurable for exchange)</li>
<li>support bitmexico</li>
<li>flag to turn bot on and off</li>
<li>separate configs per exchange bot, with core functionality in lib extracted so we can have multiple bots without code dupes</li>
<li>allow for space separated command (same syntax as command line) in POST body. This enables:</li>
<li>simpler syntax for users in the alert message box of tradingview</li>
<li>allow pinescript to setup the commands (preconfigure a bot)</li>
<li>let the user override the command by editing the message box instead of a webhook url</li>
<li>webhook url can then just simply point to the bot without querystring which is a bit cleaner</li>
<li>support % besides pct for percentages which is convenient in POST and command line like 'long 50%'</li>
<li>changed api.
<ul>
<li>replaced LONGENTRY, LONGEXIT, SHORTENTRY, SHORTEXIT, TAKEPROFIT</li>
<li>with LONG, SHORT, CLOSE</li>
<li>where CLOSE is replacing LONGEXIT, SHORTEXIT and TAKEPROFIT</li>
<li>CLOSE works the same as LONG / SHORT with percentages or absolute sizes.</li>
</ul>
<li>support for max position (enter multiple longs in a row wont blow you up)</li>
<li>auto adjust order size in case the max limit is reached. Say max position is 100% of your account and you're 50% long. Adding a 'long 100%' would in theory be 150% account size. This last order is auto adjusted to 50% so we end up at the 
maximum position size (which we wanted).</li>
<li>changed api examples to use lower case (easier to type :-))</li>
<li>early exit with more descriptive warnings in case of typo's or wrong parameters.</li>
<li>placed readme and changelog in separate files</li>
<li>added usd balance to log</li>
<li>introduced many bugs, uglified the code :-)</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.8</td>
    <td><ul>
<li>refactor directory/file structure. added lib / config directories and fixed install script for that.</li>
<li>renamed folders and use exchange/pair structure which is more scalable.</li>
<li>currency pairs should now be easy to add in the future.</li>
<li>bot configs are smaller as exchange anomalies are solved in the code.</li>
<li>separated output functions into output.php</li>
<li>this means that the url structure also changes. see INSTALLATION anf README</li>
<li>removed install.sh from the distro. not needed anymore because we include ccxt in the distro for easier setup. licence is included and is MIT, so no issues.</li>
<li>added support for ETH on Deribit and Bitmex</li>
<li>removed hardcoded local ip, added global config for adding your local ip to the whitelist</li>
<li>added exchange configs so you don't have to repeatedly put your keys in for each currency pair</li>
<li>support main accounts in exchange.config.php (default)</li>
<li>can be overridden per bot subaccount in the currency_pair/config.php (recommended)</li>
<li>made main.php more generic. Removed all hardcoded refs to BTC.</li>
<li>added INSTALLATION guide with hopefully easy steps the get going</li>
<li>log file restructuring, placed outside the public www dir (was security issue)</li>
<li>added command 'log' to show the contents of the log file,</li>
<ul>
<li>by default shows last 10 lines</li>
<li>you can give the number of lines as a parameter</li>
</ul>
<li>added 'summary' command. gives an overview for currency pair:</li>
<ul>
<li>balance</li>
<li>position</li>
<li>orders</li>
</ul>
<li>added many comments to make it easier for users to configure the bot</li>
<li>add exchange errors to the log (in raw format)</li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0.9</td>
    <td><ul>
<li>support for FTX exchange added</li>
<li>redeveloped Frostybot from the ground up using object-oriented code as far as possible</li>
<li>all output is now in JSON object format to allow for easy integration and scripting</li>
<li>changed the config structure to use a single file for easier configuration (cfg.config.php);</li>
<li>config allows for the mapping of custom symbols to market symbols so that you can keep the same custom symbols across multiple exchanges. This also allows you to specify a default symbol so that you do not need to enter the symbol param all the time.</li>
<li>added open/high/low/close/volume (ohlcv) function to get data for future planned charting capabilities</li>
<li>added caching mechanism to speed up response time and reduce exchange traffic for certain functions (lib.cache.php)</li>
<li>added SQLLite support for ohlcv data and request caching and in preparation for future capabilities (lib.database.php)</li>
<li>added error and exception handlers to ensure that all messages are captured and outputted to JSON (lib.output.php)</li>
<li>exchange output normalizers are now extended classes and produce predefined objects (lib.classes.php) in a consistent way across all supported exchanges (lib.normalizer.*.php). </li>
<li>a lot of work done to ensure that all exchanges support the same commands in exactly the same way with the same output structure.</li>
<li>wrote emulation code to generate "ohlcv" data for Deribit, since the exchange lacks ohlcv support</li>
<li>added unit test capabilties to provide accelerated testing during development (lib.unittests.php)</li>
<li>added install script to aid with download and install of Frostybot (https://tinyurl.com/frostybot-installer)</li>
